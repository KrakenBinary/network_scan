# NetScan Subnet List Feature Guide

The new subnet list functionality allows you to discover and scan multiple networks from a single command.

## How to Use the Subnet List Feature

1. Run the application with sudo (required for network operations):
   ```
   sudo python3 main.py
   ```

2. From the NetScan prompt, use the `subnets` command:
   ```
   ┌──[NetScan]─[~]
   └─$ subnets
   ```

3. You'll see a list of available subnets organized by:
   - Local subnets (from your interfaces) - highlighted in GREEN
   - Special networks (like 10.42.1.0/24) - highlighted in YELLOW
   - Common private ranges - displayed in CYAN

4. To scan a specific subnet, use:
   ```
   ┌──[NetScan]─[~]
   └─$ scan 10.42.1.0/24
   ```

5. To interrupt a scan in progress, press Ctrl+C.

## Special Features:

- **Batch Processing**: The scanner now processes IPs in batches for better performance
- **Progressive Scanning**: Uses multiple scanning techniques to find hard-to-detect devices
- **Interrupt Handling**: Scans can be stopped at any time with Ctrl+C
- **Smart Network Detection**: Prioritizes local networks but includes common private ranges

## The subnets command provides:
- Network CIDR notation (e.g., 10.42.1.0/24)
- Source of the network (interface, common range, or special network)
- Color coding for different network types

This feature helps efficiently discover devices across multiple networks without having to manually specify each network range.
